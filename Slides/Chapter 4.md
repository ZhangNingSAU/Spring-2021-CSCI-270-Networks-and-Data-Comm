## TCP/IP core protocols

![](../Resources/layer234.png)

+ TCP/IP is a suit of protocols.
+ Including TCP, IP, UDP, ARP...
+ ![](../Resources/ch4-tcpipsuit.png)
  - sending host layer 7,6,5: original data generated by some application to create a **payload**
  - sending host layer 4: TCP/UDP adds a header to the payload to create a **segment/datagram**
  - sending host layer 3: IP adds a header to the segment/datagram to create a **packet**
  - sending host layer 2: NIC adds a header and a trailer to the packet to create a **frame**
  - sending host layer 1: places the actual trasmission on the network
  - receiving host: de-encapsulates the message
  

+ Connectivity devices are known by the highest OSI layer they read and process
  - switch: layer 2 (note: there exist layer 3 switches)
  - router: layer 3
  - firewall: layer4

### TCP(transmission control protocol): a reliable delivery protocol

![](../Resources/layer4.png)

+ connection-oriented 
  - Before TCP transmits data, it ensures that a connection or session is established by a **three-way handshake**.
+ sequencing and checksums:
  - checksum:  Compare two checksum strings generated by sending and receiving host, if they fail to match, re-send the data
  - sequncing: sequencing numbers to reorder segments as they may not arrive in the order they are created.
+ flow control: the process of gauging the appropriate rate of transmission based on how quickly the recipient can accept data
![](../Resources/ch4-tcpsegment.png)

#### TCP Three-Way Handshake
![](../Resources/ch4-threewayhandshake.png)
+ Step 1: SYN (Computer A: **I want to establish a connection.**)
  - seq#: random
  - ack#: 0
  - flags: SYN
+ Step 2: SYN/ACK (Computer B: **I agree.**)
  - seq#: random
  - ack#: seq#(in step 1) + 1
  - flags: SYN/ACK
+ step 3: ACK (Computer A: **The connection is established.**)
  - seq#: ack#in step 2)
  - ack#: seq#(in step 2) + 1
  - flag: ACK
+ **note that**:
  - no payload has beed included.
  - the random seq# is not real random.
  - the increment of seq# is 1 in the three-way handshake, the increment will be the length of the message after the connection is established.
  - max packet size 64k(65535 bytes), MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) for Ethernet 1500 bytes. Find details in section **Ethernet** on textbook. 

### UDP(user datagram protocol): a unreliable, connectionless protocol

![](../Resources/layer4.png)


+ **unreliable**: UPD does not guarantee dilievery of data.
+ **connectionless**: no three-way handshake to establish a connection
+ no acknoledgment of transmission
+ no error checking
+ no sequencing
+ no flow control
+ **more efficient**

![](../Resources/ch4-udp.png)

### IP (internet protocol)

![](../Resources/layer3.png)

A layer 3 protocal that
+ identifies the data's source and destination IP addresses.
+ enable TCP/IP to internetwork - to traverse among LANs through routers
+ is a connectionless protocol - no session to be established

+ IPv4 packet
![](../Resources/ch4-ip.png)
+ IPv6 packet
![](../Resources/ch4-ipv6.png)

### ICMP (internet message control protocol)

![](../Resources/layer3.png)

+ a core layer 3 protocol that reports on the sucess or failure of data delievery to the sender, including
  - when part of the network is congested.
  - when data fails to reach its destination.
  - when data has been discarded.
  
+ note that: ICMP does not fix the failure, higher protocols such as TCP is responsible for that.

![](../Resources/ch4-icmp.png)

### ARP(address resolution protocol) on IPv4 networks

![](../Resources/layer2.png)

+ discovers MAC address on LAN
+ maintains the ARP table (realation between MAC and IP addresses)
+ sometimes is called layer 2.5 protocol, because it touches IP in layer 3 and MAC in layer 2.
+ ARP can be static (entered manually) or dynamic (created by an ARP request) 
![](../Resources/ch4-arptable.png)

### ARP Command: arp -a

![arp win](../Resources/ch4-arpwin.jpg)

![arp mac](../Resources/ch4-arpmac.png)


### Ethernet

![](../Resources/layer2.png)

+ the most popular network technology on LANs.
+ Ethernet II is the current Ethernent standard.
![](../Resources/ch4-ethernet.png)

+ MTU(maximum transmission units): the maximum payload size that a layer 2 frame can encapsulate.

## Summary
|Layer|the most important added info|
|----|----|

|3|source IP and destination IP|
|2.5|IP to MAC|
|2|source MAC and destination MAC|



## Broadcast Domain vs. Collision Domain
![](../Resources/ch4-broadcastcollison.png)
### Collision domain
+ When the transmissions of two nodes interfere with each other, a **collision** happens. After a collision, each node waits a random amount of time and then resends the transmission.
+ A **collision domain** is the portion of a network in which collisions can occur.
+ Hubs connecting multiple computers in a star-bus topology resulted in massive collisions.
### Broadcast domain
+ A **broadcast domain** is a logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer.
+ A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.

## Routers
+ A router joins two or more networks and passes packets from one network to another.
+ Routers are responsible for determining the next network to which a packet should be forwarded on its way to its destination.
+ A typical router has an internal processor, an operating system, memory, input and output jacks for different types of network connectors (depending on the network type), and, usually, a management console interface. 
### Router functions
+ all routers can do the following:
  - Connect dissimilar networks, such as a LAN and a WAN, which use different types of routing protocols.
  - Interpret Layer 3 and often Layer 4 addressing and other information (such as quality of service indicators).
  - Determine the best path for data to follow from point A to point B. The best path is the most efficient route to the message’s destination calculated by the router, based upon the information the router has available to it.
  - Reroute traffic if the path of first choice is down but another path is available.
+ optional functions:
  - Filter broadcast transmissions to alleviate network congestion.
  - Acting as a simple firewall, prevent certain types of traffic from getting to a network, enabling customized segregation and security.
  - Support simultaneous local and remote connectivity.
  - Provide high network fault tolerance through redundant components such as
power supplies or network interfaces.
  - Monitor network traffic and report statistics.
  - Diagnose internal or other connectivity problems and trigger alarms.
  
### Router classification
+ Core, edge, and exterior routers
+ **AS (autonomous system)** is a group of networks, often on the same domain, that are operated by the same organization.
![](../Resources/ch4-routerclasses.png)

### Multilayer Switches
#### Layer 3 switch 
+ A Layer 3 switch is a switch that is capable of interpreting Layer 3 data and works much like a router. 
+  Layer 3 switches were designed to work on large LANs, similar to core routers, except they’re faster and less expensive.
+ The primary difference is the way the hardware is built, but, in fact, it’s often difficult to distinguish between a Layer 3 switch and a router. 

#### Layer 4 switch
+ Layer 4 switches also exist and are capable of interpreting Layer 4 data. 
+ They operate anywhere between Layer 4 and Layer 7 and are also known as content switches or application switches. 

####
+ They are typically used as part of a network’s backbone and are not appropriate on a single LAN. 
+ In general, however, Layer 4, Layer 3, and Layer 2 switches are all optimized for fast Layer 2 data handling.
+ Keep in mind that Layer 3 and Layer 4 switches can work the same way.

### Routing Tables
+ A routing table is a database that holds information about where hosts are located and the most efficient way to reach them.
+ A router relies on its routing table to identify which network a host belongs to and which of the router’s interfaces points toward the best next hop to reach that network.

### Routing Path Types
+ **static routing**—A network administrator configures a routing table to direct mes- sages along specific paths between networks.
+ **dynamic routing**—A router automatically calculates the best path between two networks and accumulates this information in its routing table.

### Routing Metrics
Some examples of routing metrics used to determine the best path may include:
+ Hop count, which is the number of network segments crossed
+ Theoretical bandwidth and actual throughput on a potential path
+ Delay, or latency, on a potential path, which results in slower performance
+ Load, which is the traffic or processing burden sustained by a router in the path
+ MTU, which is the largest IP packet size in bytes allowed by routers in the path
without fragmentation (excludes the frame size on the local network)
+ Routing cost, which is a value assigned to a particular route as judged by the network administrator; the more desirable the path, the lower its cost
+ Reliability of a potential path, based on historical performance  
+ A network’s topology

### Routing Protocols to Determine Best Paths
+ There are routing protocols on layers 3, 4 and 7, we focus on layer 3.
+ **AD (administrative distance)**—Each routing protocol is assigned a default AD, which is a number indicating the protocol’s reliability, with lower values being given higher priority. 
+ **convergence time**—Routing protocols are also rated on the time it takes to recog- nize a best path in the event of a change or network outage.
+ overhead—A routing protocol is rated on its overhead, or the burden placed on the underlying network to support the protocol.
#### Common routing protocols
|routing protocol|Type|Algorithm used|
|----|----|----|
|RIP (Routing Information Protocol)|IGP |Distance-vector|
|RIPv2 (Routing Information Protocol, version 2)|IGP|Distance-vector|
|OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)|IGP|Link-state|
|IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)|IGP|Link-state|
|EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)|IGP|Advanced distance-vector|
|BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)*|EGP|Advanced distance-vector or path vector|

#### Interior and Exterior Gateway Protocols
+  IGPs (interior gateway protocols)
  - used by core routers and edge routers within autonomous systems.
  - IGPs are often grouped according to the algorithms they use to calculate best paths.
    + **Distance-vector routing protocols** calculate the best path to a destination
on the basis of the distance to that destination.
    + **Link-state routing protocols** enable routers to communicate beyond neighboring routers, after which each router can independently map
the network and determine the best path between itself and a message’s destination node.

+ EGPs (exterior gateway protocols) 
  - used by edge routers and exterior routers to distribute data outside of autonomous systems.


#### Legacy routing protocols
+ RIP(Routing Information Protocol) and RIP2
+ less than 15 hops
+ metric: Hop count
+ exchange of routing information: UDP with port 520
+ routing-update messages are sent 
  - at regular intervals(30s) and 
  - when the network topology changes.
  
+ example:
![rip-example](../Resources/ch4-rip.png)

  - step 1: the routing tables of all routers only contain directly-connected information(the table does not contain mask for simplicity)
    + R1
    
  |Network|Next Hop|Hop count|
  |----|----|----|
  |10.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |20.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  
    + R2
    
  |Network|Next Hop|Hop count|
  |----|----|----|
  |20.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |30.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  
    + R3
    
  |Network|Next Hop|Hop count|
  |----|----|----|
  |30.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |40.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  
 - step 2: suppose routing update happens in R2 first(it depends on the order that the routers are turned on), R2 receives the routing update from R1 and R3 and updates its routing table.
 
  |Network|Next Hop|Hop count|
  |----|----|----|
  |20.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |30.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |10.0.0.0|20.0.0.1|1|
  |40.0.0.0|30.0.0.1|1|
  
 - step 3: R2 will send its whole routing table to R1 and R3, let's deal with R1 first.
  
  |Network|Next Hop|Hop count|
  |----|----|----|
  |20.0.0.0|20.0.0.2|1|
  |30.0.0.0|20.0.0.2|1|
  |10.0.0.0|20.0.0.2|2|
  |40.0.0.0|20.0.0.2|2|
  
  **Note**: the next hop is 20.0.0.2 because R2 send its routing table to R1 through port 20.0.0.2. the hop counts increase by 1 because for each destination network, R1 can use R2 as the next hop.
  
- step 4: R1 will compare the routing table in step 3 with its original one to keep entries with new destination newworks or smaller hop count.

|Network|Next Hop|Hop count|
  |----|----|----|
  |10.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |20.0.0.0|`--`|0|
  |30.0.0.0|20.0.0.2|1|
  |40.0.0.0|20.0.0.2|2|
  
#### OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
+ core or edge routers
+ only IPv4
+ supports large networks(no hop limits )
+ complex algorithms(Calculates more efficient best paths)
+ shared data(Maintains a database of the other routers’ links.)
+ low overhead, fast convergence(keeps network bandwidth to a minimum with a very fast convergence time)
+ stability(prevent routing loops)
+ multi-vendor routers(Supported by all modern routers)
#### IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
+ core routers only
+ both IPv4 and IPv6.
#### EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
+ a fast convergence time and low network overhead
+ easier to configure and less CPU-intensive than OSPF
+ support multiple protocols 
+ limit unnecessary network traffic between routers
+ accommodates very large and heterogeneous networks
+ optimized for Cisco routers 
+ On LANs that use Cisco routers exclusively, EIGRP is generally preferred over OSPF.
#### BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
+ edge and exterior routers
+ special characteristics of BGP
  - **path-vector routing protocol**: Communicates via BGP-specific messages that travel between routers over TCP sessions.
  - **efficient**: Determines best paths based on many different factors.
  - **customizable**: Can be configured to follow policies that might, for example,
avoid a certain router, or instruct a group of routers to prefer one particular route over other available routes.
